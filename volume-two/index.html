	<p id="idea" class="callout">So the idea is a group of great musicians take over our design studio on a Friday evening and play new music inspired by a book of their choice and a filmmaker makes a film at the same time (but might not film the musicians) and we decorate the walls and invite about forty people to be a part of it all and give them free alcohol and some memories. Volume 1 has happened. Volume 2 is happening.</p>

		<p>Trains go over our heads. Our windowless arch sits underneath the lines. Twisting iron pins. Shaking stone and ballast. Imagine no driver, screaming machinery, unstoppable. We hit our own harmonic lines. The grinding squall of train-to-track. Strings on frets. Our underground skyline is made of guitars, drums, pianos, violins. The ghost in our strings wants out.</p>

		Suppressed in the Soviet Union for twenty-six years, Mikhail Bulgakov’s masterpiece is an ironic parable on power and its corruption, on good and evil, and on human frailty and the strength of love.
		<br /><br />
		Or, perhaps, these were not the words at all. Perhaps there were others to the same tune, all of them highly scandalous. But this isn’t really the point. The point is that a veritable babel broke loose in the Variety Theatre after the final scene. Militiamen ran towards Sempleyarov’s loge, the curious clambered up the barriers, there were infernal bursts of roaring laughter and wild shouts, drowned out by the golden jingling of the cymbals in the band. And the stage was suddenly empty. That swindler Fagot, along with the brazen tom, Behemoth, dissolved into thin air, vanished as utterly as the magician had vanished earlier, together with his faded armchair.

THE PLACE 
OF DEAD ROADS 
BY WILLIAM 
S BURROUGHS

William Burrough's surreal fable, set in America's Old West, features a cast of notorious characters. The Crying Gun, who breaks into tears at the sight of his opponent; The Priest, who goes into gunfights giving his adversaries the last rites; and the Nihilistic Kid himself, who sets out to challenge the morality of small-town America.

Kim procured some sacred mushrooms from his Indian lover, which he brewed in a clay pot and crooned over it and spit in it and just before sunset we all take the potion and Kim’s spirit guide leads us to a room we had never seen before huge house anyhoo and we find trunks full of female clothes so we dress up and camp around Kim calls himself the Green Nun, and Tom does the Pious Senora, and Boy is the blushing Senorita. The Green Nun rummages around and finds a brace of double-barreled twenty-gauge shotgun pistols perfectly balanced with rubber grips and her loads it with number-four shot.
